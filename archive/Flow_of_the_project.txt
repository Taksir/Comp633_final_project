1. Generate Random LCP
2. Read the Random LCP
3. Vectorize the Random LCP (sequential vs parallel)
4. Count Kmers that appear once (sequential vs parallel)
5. Count Kmers that appear once and twice (sequential vs parallel)
6. Count Kmers that appear once and twice + obtain once-Kmer indices (sequential vs parallel)
